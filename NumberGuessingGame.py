    Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
    ===========================================
    Rules:
    1. The computer will select a random number between 1 and 100.
    2. Choose a difficulty level by entering:
        1 - Easy (10 attempts)
        2 - Medium (7 attempts)
        3 - Hard (5 attempts)
    3. After each guess, I'll tell you if the number is higher or lower.
    4. Guess correctly before your attempts run out!
    ===========================================
